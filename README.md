# DSIRE_API_Calls
Python script to help with loading and updating data from DSIRE

This script is written to help speed up loading new data from the Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency (DSIRE, https://www.dsireusa.org/)

If you want to save data locally, this script will automatically update any additions or changes to the DSIRE dataset without needed to find the most recent cached file on the website.
